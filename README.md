# Anima Project

Welcome! This project has been automatically generated by [Anima](https://animaapp.com/).

## Backend API (Vercel Serverless Functions)
- All backend endpoints are implemented as serverless functions in the `api/` directory inside this `project/` folder.
- Each file in `api/` is an endpoint (e.g., `api/wishlist.ts` â†’ `/api/wishlist`).
- Designed for Vercel deployment (no Express server, no local file uploads).
- Uses PostgreSQL for data storage (see `.env` for connection string).
